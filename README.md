Implementation of the RL agent Dreamer from https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01603 paper.
I relied manly on the following repos: https://github.com/juliusfrost/dreamer-pytorch
                                       https://github.com/RajGhugare19/dreamerv2
and on  rlpyt library from replay buffers and rollouts (https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt)                   

Logs can be loaded on tensorboard with command:
                                         tensorboard --logdir =logs/ --host localhost --port 8088

Training are performed on the jupyter notebooks running the code
